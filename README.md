## Personal Website

The site is live at https://keeganmongru.com

### Project Description

This project is a showcase of personal projects that I have created along with a contact page to connect with me directly. I used **JavaScript**, **React** and **Figma** to design and implement the site. I learned about CSS animations and API calls with axios for automated email submissions with a react-hook-form & email.js APIs.

### Next Steps

- Implement Framer
- Implement TypeScript
